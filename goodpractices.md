## good practices i learned while creating this project:
- parent- explicit height for flex to work
- in nextjs, sign-up/[[...signup]] has 2 brackets. the inner bracket means anything like sign-up/a/b, sign-up/a etc. and the outer bracket makes it optional. so now, even sign-up would be listened to.
- display block set krdo when aap media queries add kr rhe ho responsive banane ke liye.. when for ex. you set display to hidden for default, then lg:block kr diya. chalega.
- always media queries ke sath sath project build up kro. no need of first making a prototype and then adding the media queries. otherwise tumko kabhi bhi mann nai krega apne website ko responsive banane ka.
